# Advanced-DS-Project
School Project that aims to evaluate multiple Unsupervised learning technics on different datasets. On this notebook, we can find :

* Different visualisations on text data
* Text normalisations and numerisation using Word Embeddings
* Dimenesional reduction (PCA, t-SNE, umap)
* 2d and 3d visualisation on the docs
* Evaluation of the cluster numbers
* Benchmark using multiple clustering algorithmes (k-means, spherical kmeans, k-medoids, hierarchical clustering)
* more advanced clustering technics...
